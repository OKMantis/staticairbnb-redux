A container is a smart component and has direct access to one or several pieces of the Redux state.

A component is dumb and is just a React component that doesn't need access to the Redux state tree.

Inside this app:

1. The map is a container (needs info from the Redux state tree)
2. Flat is a container because there's an action (changing the flat when clicked on new one)
3. The entire app is just a component (it needs no access to the Redux state tree)


Provider
You import the provider and put it around the App.

Store
The store we give to the provider is built from the createStore method that we get from the Redux library.

Reducer combination
The store needs reducers to work. We create one reducer for every key in the Redux state tree and combine those reducers to pass to the store. That's why you need the combineReducers as well.

Redux state tree
Our Redux state tree has flats. The flats are handled by the flatsReducer. The flatsReducer's job is to handle this part of the Redux state tree. For every key in the Redux state tree you have a single reducer. The reducer we import from the reducer folder.
