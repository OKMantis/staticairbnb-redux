A container is a smart component and has direct access to one or several pieces of the Redux state.

A component is dumb and is just a React component that doesn't need access to the Redux state tree.

Inside this app:

1. The map is a container (needs info from the Redux state tree)
2. Flat is a container because there's an action (changing the flat when clicked on new one)
3. The entire app is just a component (it needs no access to the Redux state tree)
